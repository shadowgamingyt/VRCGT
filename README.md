## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Download:** Get the latest release from [Releases](../../releases) or build from source
2. **Run:** Launch `VRCGroupTools.exe`
   - **Windows SmartScreen Warning?** This appears because the app isn't code-signed (signing certificates cost $$$). The app is safe and open source. Click **"More info"** → **"Run anyway"**
3. **Login:** Enter your VRChat credentials + 2FA code
4. **Set Group:** Enter your Group ID (`grp_...` or short code) in the sidebar
5. **Explore:** Navigate modules from the left sidebar

### 🛡️ Security Note

**Windows SmartScreen Warning:** The application may show "Windows protected your PC" on first run. This is normal for unsigned applications. To proceed:
1. Click **"More info"**
2. Click **"Run anyway"**

The application is:
- ✅ **Open Source** - All code is visible on GitHub
- ✅ **Scanned by GitHub Actions** - Built in a clean environment
- ✅ **No Telemetry** - Your data stays local
- ✅ **Community Verified** - Check the issues and discussions

**Why unsigned?** Code signing certificates cost $300-500/year. Once the project grows, we'll invest in proper signing.
